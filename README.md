# char_gen
a random character generator for rpg pcs or npcs containing personality/flaws/goals

Just a random character generator I use to guide my RPG characters when I don't 
want to just do my normal play style.  I thought about adding an export feature
but this does everything I need it to do.  Interested in any feedback, added
attributes, or add-ons/ways to improve this project
